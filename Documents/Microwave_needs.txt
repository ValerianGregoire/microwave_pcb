In a general way, microwaves need the following components to operate properly :

- A turntable: The rotating plate that allows food to cook evenly. This plate is rotated using a motor.

- A magnetron: The component that produces the microwaves. Operates at voltages around 3-4kV.

- A transformer: Converts high current low voltage to low current, high voltage, allowing the magnetron to operate.

- A cooling fan: Keeps the microwave components inside of their operating temperature range.

- A power cord: Connects the microwave to power outlets.

- A control panel : Makes the user interface of the microwave. We will assume our model uses :
	- 4 digit display module to display the time - 2.4 VDC
	- 1 button to parametrize the time display - 12 VDC
	- 2 control knobs (rotary encoders) to select power and duration - 5 VDC
	- A buzzer : Alerts the user that the cooking is done - 7 VDC
	- 1 Reed switch to turn the LED on when the door opens - 200 VDC
	- 1 Power plug - 500 VAC/2.5 A

- A microcontroller : Controls general operations of the microwave and keeps precise time readings in memory

INPUT VOLTAGE BETWEEN 5.5V & 6V
